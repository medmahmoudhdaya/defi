# 🌱 Eco-Hospital Simulator  
### A Gamified RSE Platform for Sustainable Healthcare

The **Eco-Hospital Simulator** is an interactive platform that helps hospitals understand and reduce their environmental impact.  
It uses simulation, simple decision-making, and gamification to teach sustainable practices in a fun and engaging way.

This project was created with **Laravel**, **Inertia.js**, and **React**, following the principles of **RSE by Design**, where sustainability and ethics are embedded into every part of the system.
